* Marvell UART : Non standard UART used in some of Marvell EBU SoCs
                 e.g., Armada-3700.

Required properties:
- compatible: "marvell,armada-3700-uart" matches the standard, not
	      extended UART IP.
	      "marvell,armada-3700-uart-ext" is for the extended UART
	      port which has an extended IP and also some
	      registers/bitfields that moved compared to the other IP.
	      Using a different compatible for this type of port
	      allows to automatically select the right offsets.
- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
- clocks: UART reference clock used to derive the baudrate.
- interrupts: device interrupts. Each UART IP has two interrupt lines,
              dedicated to both RX and TX interrupts, so called "uart-rx"
	      and "uart-tx". The standard (ie. not extendend) port has a
	      third interrupt line which is an OR of both RX and TX
	      interrupts, so called "uart-sum". The driver currently
	      uses "uart-rx" and "uart-tx" for both ports whereas older
	      versions used only the summed interrupt (when only the
	      standard UART port was supported). The standard port uses
	      level interrupts while the extended port uses front
	      interrupts.

Example:
	uart0: serial@12000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-uart";
		reg = <0x12000 0x200>;
		clocks = <&xtalclk>;
		interrupts =
		<GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		<GIC_SPI 12 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		<GIC_SPI 13 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "uart-sum", "uart-tx", "uart-rx";
		status = "disabled";
	};

	uart1: serial@12200 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-uart-ext";
		reg = <0x12200 0x30>;
		clocks = <&xtalclk>;
		interrupts =
		<GIC_SPI 30 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
		<GIC_SPI 31 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		interrupt-names = "uart-tx", "uart-rx";
		status = "disabled";
	};
